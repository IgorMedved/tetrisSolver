# tetrisSolver
Finally the solver is ready! It works great and can actually beat the game unlike me as my reflexes are not fast enough to play on faster levels. Here is a little demo

Of course you can compile the whole thing and see for yourself. Just don't forget the resources directory that has the pictures for the UI (I am working on getting an installer ready)

There is also a small settings bar added with help and a few other options
