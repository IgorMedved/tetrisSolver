# tetrisSolver
Finally the solver for tetris game is ready! It works great and can actually beat the game unlike me as my reflexes are not fast enough to play on faster levels. Here is a little demo of how it plays by itself

Of course you can still play your favorite game and easily switch between auto mode and normal game mode. If you have difficulties playing you can switch the arrow hints on and off that show how to move the current figure to the optimal location.
You can compile the whole thing and see for yourself. Just don't forget the resources directory that has the pictures for the UI (I am working on getting an installer ready)

There is also a small settings bar added with help and a few other options
